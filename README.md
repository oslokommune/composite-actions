Composite building blocks for GitHub Actions workflows

Read [Creating a composite action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-composite-action) to learn what this is about.

Composite Actions allow you to combine multiple tasks and operations into a single step that can be used repeatedly within a job. This can reduce unecessary noise in workflows and make them easier to follow.
